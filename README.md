<b>CORONA VIRUS TRACKING</b>

The Corona Virus Tracking application I have developed with Flutter is ready for the android platform and I want to publish it for everyone to use.

Application features:
- Instant updated detailed statistical information
- Summary and detailed information reinforced with graphics
- Country rankings by virus status
- Search the country you want
- Easily follow-up with the follow-up list
- 7 language support (Turkish, English, Spanish, Italian, French, German, Portuguese)

This app does not contain advertising and is not for profit.
